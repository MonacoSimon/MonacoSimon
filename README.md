## Hi there, I'm Simón Mónaco 👋
I am a student of Systems and Software Development, with a strong interest in starting my
professional career in the IT field, in roles such as frontend or backend developer, systems
analyst, QA (tester), infrastructure, or related positions. My short-term goal is to enter the
technology sector while continuing and completing my studies. In the long term, I aspire to keep
growing professionally and obtain a Bachelor’s degree at the National University of La Plata, a
personal project that deeply motivates me. I am seeking my first work experience in IT, where I
can contribute commitment, continuous learning, and a strong desire to grow, while developing
my technical and professional skills.
